# To-dos
## Tools
### MDL
  * [x] Start on. Look at parsing them.

## Code structure
  * [x] Put Lenses in Has. Change the functions from `get` to `zoom` (matching
        the Lensyness).

## CLI
  * [x] See how ghcup does it's CLI options (particularly verbose flag) *-- it's
    all manual I'm afraid, we do similar things for `--x,--no-x`*
